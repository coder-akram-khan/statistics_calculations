# statistics_calculations
This repository demonstrates Python code for calculating key statistical measures (mean, variance, standard deviation, quartiles, IQR) from a speed dataset. It also includes outlier detection using Tukey's method and a visual representation of the data distribution through a box plot.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Analysis:**
    * Calculates mean, variance, and standard deviation of the speed data.
    * Determines quartiles (Q1, Q3) and interquartile range (IQR).
    * Identifies potential outliers using Tukey's method.
* **Visualization:**
    * Generates a box plot to visually represent the distribution of speed values.

**Usage:**

1. **Install required libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib

    Run the script:
    Bash

    python stat.py 

Output:

The script will print the following to the console:

    Mean
    Variance
    Standard Deviation
    Q1
    Q3
    IQR
    Lower Fence
    Upper Fence
    Outliers
    Deviations from the mean for each data point

Additionally, a box plot of the speed data will be displayed.
